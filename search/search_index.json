Setting Up the Development Environment for Rust","text":"<p>Development Containers</p> <p>A development(dev) container is a preconfigured environment that makes sure that your development environment is consistent. Dev containers are defined by a set of files and usually use Docker to create isolated setups. This is important because it allows everyone to work in an identical environment which reduces bugs and simplifies onboarding new members.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/rust-setup/#step-1-add-development-container-configuration","title":"Step 1. Add Development Container Configuration","text":"<ol> <li>In VS Code, open the <code>comp-423-rust-tutorial</code> directory. You can do this by clicking File, then Open Folder.</li> </ol> <p>2) Install the Dev container extension for VS Code.</p> <p>3) Specify configuration for a standardized development environment using a Docker image. To do this, create a <code>.devcontainer</code> directory in the root of your project with the file <code>.devcontainer/devcontainer.json</code> inside of this \"hidden\" configuration directory.</p> <p>This file defines the configuration for your development environment. It will specify the name, image, and customizations for your dev container. The name should descripe your dev container. The image we will use is the base immage Microsoft maintains for Rust. The extension we will install is the official rust-analyzer VSCode plugin.</p> <p>In this file put the following: <pre><code>{\n  \"name\": \"COMP423 Rust Tutorial\",\n  \"image\": \"mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/rust:latest\",\n  \"customizations\": {\n    \"vscode\": {\n      \"settings\": {},\n      \"extensions\": [\"rust-lang.rust-analyzer\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> Step 2. Reopen the Project in a VSCode Dev Container</p> <p>Reopen the project in the container by pressing <code>Ctrl+Shift+P</code> or if you are on a Mac <code>Cmd+Shift+P</code>, then type \"Dev Containers: Reopen in Container\" and select that option. This may take a few minutes to install and dowload everything. Once this completes, you can close the current terminal tab.</p> <p>Step 3. Open a new terminal tab in VSCode and try running <code>rustc --version</code> to see your dev container is running a recent version of rust!</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/rust-setup/#part-3-creating-a-new-rust-project","title":"Part 3. Creating a new Rust Project","text":"<p>Rust is the programming language we have installed through the dev container we just set up, and what language we will be writing our \"Hello COMP423\" in. In Rust, a crate is an executable program. Rather than simply compiling our crates using the Rust compiler, <code>rustc</code>, we will be using Cargo in this tutorial. Cargo is the package manager for Rust and does the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Runs <code>rustc</code></p> </li> <li> <p>Creates two metadata files</p> </li> <li> <p>Builds and fetches your package's dependencies</p> </li> <li> <p>Simplifies working with Rust packes via normalizing commands</p> </li> </ul> <p>1) Use the <code>cargo new</code> command to start a new package with Cargo, and specify that we want to create a binary project. This will automatically make a new git repo which we do not want to do here, so use the <code>--vsc none</code> flag. Open the terminal in your VS Code dev container you just set up and run the following: <pre><code>cargo new hello_comp423 --bin --vcs none \ncd hello_comp423\n</code></pre></p> <p>The <code>--vsc none</code> flag does not create a new <code>git</code> repository automatically on your behalf. The <code>--bin</code> flag means that we are making a binary program.</p> <p>You should now see a <code>hello_comp423</code> directory. Click on this to see the files that the <code>cargo new</code> command created.</p> <p>Cargo.toml</p> <p>The <code>Cargo.toml</code> file is called a manifest and it contains data written in TOML format that Cargo uses to compile your package.</p> <p>2) Now, open <code>src/main.rs</code>, and modify its contents to be:</p> <pre><code>fn main() {\n    println!(\"Hello COMP423\");\n}\n</code></pre> <p>3) To complile and run the program, you can do one of two things: use <code>cargo build</code> to compile your program, and and then run your program using its file path, or simply use <code>cargo run</code> to both complie and run your program with one command.</p> <ul> <li>Compile and run in two steps:</li> </ul> <pre><code>cargo build\n./target/debug/hello_comp423\n</code></pre> <p>cargo build and gcc</p> <p>Rust's <code>cargo build</code> is similar to C's <code>gcc</code> in that they compile the program without running it.</p> <ul> <li>Use <code>cargo run</code> to compile and run in one step.</li> </ul> <p>You should try compliling and running your program with both of these methods for practice. Notice that both produce the same output: <pre><code>   Compiling hello_comp423 v0.1.0 (/workspaces/comp423-rust-tutorial/hello_comp423)\n    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.32s\nHello COMP423\n</code></pre></p> <p>Now that you have set up your dev container and written a \"Hello COMP423\", you should stage, commit, and push your work to GitHub! Remeber to use <code>git push origin main</code> when pushing your changes.</p> <p>To learn more about Rust and Cargo, check out their documentation linked here!</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/rust-setup/#references","title":"References","text":"<p>[1] K.
